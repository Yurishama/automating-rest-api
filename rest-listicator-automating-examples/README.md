# rest-listicator-automating-examples

Example automated execution code for REST Listicator test application.

Used in REST API Testing Training by [Alan Richardson](https://compendiumdev.co.uk/).

 Feel free to use this course to learn more about testing REST APIs with Rest Assured.

> Suggested Exercise - Critique the code:
>
>  - what does the abstraction layer prevent you from doing?
>  - are the methods well named?
>  - the `ListCreationTest` has been built to demonstrate the build up of abstractions. What else would you add to it?
>  - how would you structure the code?


 The code is not intended to be a 'best practice' approach to automating or using REST Assured.
