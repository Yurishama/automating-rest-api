# Description

Web based applications often offer more than a GUI to interact with, very often they have an API layer. This layer clearly needs testing and we can use it to support our other testing efforts - GUI, performance, etc. In this tutorial we will work with several applications to learn the basics of automating and testing REST APIs.

---

# You will learn:

- Basics of REST Web Services
- What tools we can use to interact with REST APIs
- How we can use REST APIs in our testing
- How to test a REST API
- Multiple ways to automate REST Web Service APIs
- Abstraction layers for automating REST APIs

---

# Hands on Experience

You will gain hands on experience with:

- Exploratory Testing REST APIs
- Using different tools to interact with a REST API
- Automating a REST API

This tutorial uses a mix of presentation, demos, discussion and hands on exercises to create an immersive and fast paced interactive day of learning.
