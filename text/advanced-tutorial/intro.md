## Description

Workshop/Tutorial means that we will have discussions and do exercises to experiment and learn.

Not all the answers are found in the presenter or the slides. The answers are in the room and in the discussions.

You take control of your workshop.

- If exercises are too easy:
    - try the different serialisation exercises
    - try working through the abstraction exercises early


---

## We aim to cover

- Overview of the basics to achieve common understanding:
    - basics of: API, HTTP, REST
    - tooling interaction: Postman, Insomnia, Proxies
    - automating basics: REST Assured

We will then look at the 'advanced' content...


---

## Advanced Content

- More Detailed look at REST Assured library for Automating a REST API in Java
- Automating through an HTTP Proxy
- parsing JSON and XML
- using JAVA HTTP libraries
- Abstraction layers: payload objects, API abstraction, HTTP library abstraction
- Performance/Stress testing of API
- Coverage of API Testing and approaches to support this
- Writing Bots for interleaved API functional testing

Anything else we need to discuss?

---

## Hands on Experience

You will gain hands on experience with:

- Automating a REST API
- Creating Abstraction Layers for a REST API
- Refactoring code to abstraction layers
- Writing bots for an API

---

## Requirements

Requirements to attend workshop:

- You will need a laptop to take part
- Wifi connection
- You will need the ability to install software on to your laptop
- During the workshop we will use REST Client and an HTTP Proxy
