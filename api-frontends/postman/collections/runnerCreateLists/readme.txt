this directory contains postman collections that should be use with the Postman Collection Runner

They need environment variable {{host}} setup to point to the host of the REST Listicator e.g. 'localhost:4567'

And use the appropriate data file e.g. Create Lists - listdata.csv, create Users - usersdata.csv
